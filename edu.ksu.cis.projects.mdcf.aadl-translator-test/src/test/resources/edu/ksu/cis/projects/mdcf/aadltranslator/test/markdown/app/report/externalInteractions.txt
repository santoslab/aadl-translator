## External Interactions

### Successor Dangers

* DerivedAlarm: {MissedAlarm, BogusAlarm}


### Manifestations

* SpO2: {SpO2ValueHigh (HIGH), ~~SpO2ValueLow (LOW)~~, ~~EarlySpO2 (EARLY)~~, ~~LateSpO2 (LATE)~~}


### Externally Caused Dangers

* MtoN: Placeholder explanation
	* *Successor Danger(s)* DerivedAlarm: BogusAlarm (VIOLATEDCONSTRAINT), MissedAlarm (VIOLATEDCONSTRAINT)
	* *Manifestation(s)* SpO2: SpO2ValueLow (LOW), SpO2ValueHigh (HIGH)
	* *Process Variable* : 
* MultipleOutputs: Placeholder explanation
	* *Successor Danger(s)* DerivedAlarm: MissedAlarm (VIOLATEDCONSTRAINT), BogusAlarm (VIOLATEDCONSTRAINT)
	* *Manifestation(s)* SpO2: SpO2ValueHigh (HIGH)
	* *Process Variable* : 
* MultipleInputs: Placeholder explanation
	* *Successor Danger(s)* DerivedAlarm: MissedAlarm (VIOLATEDCONSTRAINT)
	* *Manifestation(s)* SpO2: SpO2ValueHigh (HIGH), SpO2ValueLow (LOW)
	* *Process Variable* : 
* HighSpO2LeadsToMissedAlarm: The SpO2 value is too high, leading the app to fail to issue an alarm when it should
	* *Successor Danger(s)* DerivedAlarm: MissedAlarm (VIOLATEDCONSTRAINT)
	* *Manifestation(s)* SpO2: SpO2ValueHigh (HIGH)
	* *Process Variable* SpO2Val: Higher than true value


### Sunk Dangers

* LateSpO2DoesNothing: Not dangerous
	* *Successor Danger(s)* SpO2: 
	* *Detections* 
		* TimestampViolation: Messages should be timestamped so latency violations can be detected (CONCURRENT)
	* *Handlings* 
		* SwitchToNoOutput: The pump switches into a fail-safe mode, ie, it runs at a minimal (KVO) rate (ROLLFORWARD)
* LowSpO2DoesNothing: Not dangerous
	* *Successor Danger(s)* SpO2: 
	* *Detections* 
		* 
	* *Handlings* 
		* 
* EarlySpO2DoesNothing: Not dangerous
	* *Successor Danger(s)* SpO2: 
	* *Detections* 
		* TimeoutViolation: Minimum separation between messages are added to detect early arrivals (CONCURRENT)
	* *Handlings* 
		* SwitchToNoOutput: The pump switches into a fail-safe mode, ie, it runs at a minimal (KVO) rate (ROLLFORWARD)
