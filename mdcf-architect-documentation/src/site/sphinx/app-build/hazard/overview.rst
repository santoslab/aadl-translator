Hazard Analysis Overview
########################

Once your application has been modeled in the :ref:`supported subset of AADL<aadl-subset-overview>`, you can annotate it to include hazard analysis information.  This information will then be used our translator to produce a hazard analysis report. This work was first discussed in this |MEMOCODE14 publication|.

These annotations include both custom properties and a subset of AADL's error-modeling (EMV2) annex, and the report format is derivative of / inspired by |STPA|.

In this language walkthrough, we'll be re-using the app developed in the :ref:`aadl-subset-overview`. The above app diagram has been annotated with two errors (in red). You can :download:`download the annotated model<snippets/pulse-ox-forwarding.zip>` or :download:`view the generated report<PulseOx_Forwarding_System.html>`.

Since our process and format are based on STPA, we focus first on hazard analysis :ref:`fundamentals<hazard-analysis-fundamentals>` (eg, accidents to be avoided, safety constraints that prevent them, etc.) then look at how faults can :ref:`occur<hazard-analysis-occurrence>` on potentially unsafe control actions (which are equivalent to system level :construct:`port connections<portconnection>` in our system) and finally document their architectural causes and impacts in individual :ref:`components<hazard-analysis-components>`.

One of the main goals of this work was to integrate the top-down nature of STPA with the bottom-up, component-focused EMv2.  To that end, the tooling enables developers / analysts to work in either direction (top-down or bottom-up) or use the two methodologies in tandem to drive analysis forward.
