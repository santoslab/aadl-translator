The Occurrence Property
#######################

The *occurrence* property is designed to do associate three main things with one particular way a control action could be provided in an unsafe way:

1. Relevant STPA :ref:`fundamentals<hazard-analysis-fundamentals>`
2. A human-readable description of the fault's cause and compensation
3. A specific fault and control action

The occurrence property (or, more likely, list of properties) should be placed in an EMv2 annex in the app's :construct:`System Implementation<systemimplementation>`.

.. property:: occurrence

   An assumption about the environment / clinical process where the app will be used.

   :type: Record
   :subproperty Kind: The STPA keyword associated with this hazardous occurrence
   :subproperty Hazard: The hazard (as documented in the preliminaries file) associated with this hazardous occurrence
   :subproperty ViolatedConstraint: The safety constraint (as documented in the preliminaries file) associated with this hazardous occurrence
   :subproperty Title: A short title for the occurrence
   :subproperty Cause: A human-readable cause for for the occurrence
   :subproperty Compensation: Any compensatory steps that could be taken, or an explicit recognition that there is no way to compensate for this hazardous occurrence
   :subproperty Impact: The EMv2 fault type representing the impact if this hazardous occurrence comes to pass.  This fault type should be propagated out of the component that is the source of the :construct:`connection<portconnection>` this property is applied to, and propagated into the component that is the sink of the connection.
   :type Kind: One of ``NotProviding``, ``Providing``, ``Early``, ``Late``, ``AppliedTooLong``, ``StoppedTooSoon``, ``ValueLow``, ``ValueHigh``, ``ParamsMissing``, ``ParamsWrong``, or ``ParamsOutOfOrder``
   :type Hazard: :property:`Hazard<hazard>`
   :type ViolatedConstraint: :property:`Constraint<constraint>`
   :type Title: AADLString
   :type Cause: AADLString
   :type Compensation: AADLString
   :type Impact: :construct:`Error Type<errortype>`
   :context: :construct:`System Implementation<systemimplementation>`
   :example: 

.. note:: The context must be set explicitly via the ``applies to`` operator, rather than by embedding this property in its context (see line 24 in the example below).

Unsafe Control Actions
======================

The occurrence properties (and supporting fundamentals) are used to generate tables of unsafe control actions.  There are two tables created: the first looks at all :construct:`port connections<portconnection>` (which are the system's control actions and feedback messages) as simple events, and documents how they could fail:

+------------------+-----------+------------------------+------------------+------------------+-------+------+
| Control Action   | Providing | Not providing          | Applied Too Long | Stopped Too Soon | Early | Late |
+==================+===========+========================+==================+==================+=======+======+
| spo2_to_display  |           |                        |                  |                  |       |      |
+------------------+-----------+------------------------+------------------+------------------+-------+------+
| alarm_to_display |           | MissedAlarm (Bad SpO2) |                  |                  |       |      |
+------------------+-----------+------------------------+------------------+------------------+-------+------+

The second table looks at port connections with ranged types (eg, integers and floats) and documents how they could fail:

+-----------------+----------------------------+---------------+
| Control Action  | Value Too High             | Value Too Low |
+=================+============================+===============+
| spo2_to_display | BadInfoDisplayed (BadSpO2) |               |
+-----------------+----------------------------+---------------+

Causes and Compensations
========================

The human-readable causes and compensations are then compiled into a list, organized by :construct:`port connection<portconnection>`:


**alarm_to_display**

* NOTPROVIDING: Bad SpO2
	* Cause: Incorrect SpO2 values are sent to the display
	* Compensation: The SpO2 values from the pulse oximeter are too high, so the alarm is missed

**spo2_to_display**

* VALUEHIGH: Bad SpO2
	* Cause: Incorrect SpO2 values are sent to the display
	* Compensation: None
