Modeling with MDCF Architect
****************************

The MDCF Architect is a toolset for the development of physiometric devices and
controller applications for
`Medical Application Platforms <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6197383&tag=1>`_
(MAPs). Tooling supports the automatic translation of |DML| models of such
device and app components into |AADL| models, and from there into |MDCF|
compatible, executable code as well as the generation of hazard analysis reports.
